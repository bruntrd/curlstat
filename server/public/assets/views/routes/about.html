                    <p>This is a curling statistical web app.  It was designed to get rid of the bulky cameras and laptops and to get with the times.
                        Still aimed to provide users with ability to take meaningful statistics from anywhere.  No longer will coaches be setting up
                        equipment and struggling to find a good spot at whatever even they are at.  This app is responsive to tablets, phones or whatever
                        device the user has at hand.  And once you are a registered user, you can access your past stats from anywhere.</p>

                    <p>As said before this program was designed by a curler, for curlers.  A two time national champion and member of the United States National Team, Ryan saw a need
                    for a program that allowed easy access to the stat program as well as the stats itself.  Its 2015 and there are still coaches using pen and paper!  Not to mention
                    lugging around laptops hooked up to cameras. Once your team is signed up anyone with the username and password can access past games, notes and situations that you've previously recorded. </p>

                    <h1 class="md-padding">How to use the app</h1>
                    <p>The app is very straight forward and easy to use whether this is the first game scored or you've worked with other programs
                    in the past.  The first step is entering the game info, which is especially important if you have registered and want to save the
                    results. You are also able to edit the information at any point during the game. After you've got that information entered you are on to the program.    The shot inputs are very easy to understand, but make
                    sure to choose one for each stat to get accurate stats.  Once the game is completed, hit end game and you are sent to the statistical
                    breakdown.  There it lays out your current game statistics compared with your season average if you are a registered team.  Hit save game
                    after you are done looking and you are ready for another game!</p>

                    <p>This program is a work in progress.  Right now the development team is working on upgraded features.  Including access to the camera on your device, instead
                    of using the virtual house that is provided.  There will be advanced stats available for registered teams that are customizable.  Teams should be able to pick
